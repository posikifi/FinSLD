Finnish SLD library

This is library of SLD-files of Finnish Geographic Information datasets. 

Idea is setup directory for each (open) dataset. Each dataset has several SLDs (default, bright, background etc.) 
and also sample data. Or data to build with.

At least following datasets will be included:

- Maastotietokanta (Topographic Database)
- Pienimittakaavaiset (Small scale datasets 1:1; 1:4,5M and others)

Metsäntutkimuslaitos
